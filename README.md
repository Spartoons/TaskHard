# TaskHard 🎯

**TaskHard** is an experimental project that might (or might not) end up as a useful task management tool. We're playing around with four popular productivity methods—**Eisenhower Matrix**, **GTD (Getting Things Done)**, **Time Boxing**, and **Pomodoro Technique**—and seeing if we can mash them together into one simple tool that actually helps you get stuff done. Honestly, no clue if this is going to work, but hey, let’s give it a shot!

## Features (or ideas, really) 🛠️

- **Task Categorization** using the **Eisenhower Matrix** (Urgent/Important).
- **GTD**-inspired capture and review process.
- **Time Boxing** for blocking out time to focus on specific tasks.
- **Pomodoro Timer** for focus.
- Super basic and open to contributions because we have no idea where this is going.

The flow should be something like:

1. Input Tasks: Capture all tasks by scanning emails or manually entering them (like in GTD).
2. Clarify & Categorize: Break tasks down into actionable steps, then sort them into the Eisenhower Matrix based on urgency and importance.
3. Time Blocking: Use your calendar to schedule time blocks for important tasks, focusing on those in the "Important and Urgent" category first.
4. Pomodoro: Break larger tasks into Pomodoro sessions (e.g., 25-minute work intervals) to stay productive during each time block.
5. Review: At the end of the day/week, review your progress, adjust priorities, and re-schedule tasks for the next period.

## Installation 💻

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Spartoons/TaskHard.git
   cd TaskHard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if there are any at this point):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run TaskHard**:
   ```bash
   python taskhard.py
   ```
But be carfeul, I'm a mess organizing (kind of the point of why I'm doing this project) so probably would be difficult to understand the files and folders organization, srry about that :).

## Usage 🚀

Right now, you’ll need to add your tasks manually and categorize them using the **Eisenhower Matrix**. Then, you can set up time blocks in your calendar and use the built-in **Pomodoro timer** to work on them.

To be honest, it’s a bit rough at the moment, but feel free to try it out and see what happens!

## Contributing 🤝

We’re not even sure how this project will evolve yet, but if you’re curious and want to add your ideas (or fix our mistakes), feel free to jump in. 

1. Fork the Project.
2. Make a cool new feature or fix.
3. Open a Pull Request.

We’ll probably say, "Sure, why not?" and then "F***, this person is working harder than me in my own project, I feel awful about my life.".

## License 📄

This project is licensed under the **None** - don't know how licenses work and have no time to deep into it, so for now I won't.

## Notes 🙃

- We have no roadmap. If something works, it’ll end up here. If not, well, it was fun trying.
- Expect bugs. Maybe even gremlins.
- Come in with low expectations, and you’ll probably have a good time! (Don't think so)
